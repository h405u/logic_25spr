\begin{exercise}{1.2}
  Verify the validity of the deduction step in the following statement:

  I can doubt that the physical world exists. I can even doubt whether my body really exists. I cannot doubt that I myself exist. So I am not my body.

  \hfill \textemdash\ Descartes

\end{exercise}

A formalization could be:

Premises:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $can\_doubt(I, physical\_world)$,
  \item $can\_doubt(I, my\_body)$,
  \item $cannot\_doubt(I, I)$.
\end{enumerate}
Conclusion:

$\neg =(I, my\_body)$.

It is straightforward that the deduction step is invalid.

Note that $cannot\_doubt$ instead of $\neg can\_doubt$ are used to capture the subjective nature of ``doubt''. $be$ instead of $=$ might be used in conclusion, in repect of that relations between pairs of expressions in natual languages may not qualify as ``equality'' that we refer to in formal languages.
