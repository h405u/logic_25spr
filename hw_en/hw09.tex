\begin{exercise}{9.4}
  Restate the definition of ``$\mathfrak{A}$ satisfies $\varphi$ with $s$'' by defining recursively a function $\overline{h}$ such that $\mathfrak{A}$ satisfies $\varphi$ with $s$ iff $s\in \overline{h}(\varphi).$

\begin{exercise}{9.5}
  [Enderton, ex.~9, p.~100]
  Assume that the language has equality and a two-place predicate symbol $P$. For each of the following conditions, find a sentence $\sigma$ such that the structure $\mathfrak{A}$ is a model of $\sigma$ iff the condition is met.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item $|\mathfrak{A}|$ has exactly two members.
    \item $P^{\mathfrak{A}}$ is a function from $|\mathfrak{A}|$ into $|\mathfrak{A}|$. (A \textit{function} is a single-valued relation, as in Chapter 0. For $f$ to be a function from $A$ into $B$, the domain of $f$ must be all of $A$; the range of $f$ is a subset, not necessarily proper, of $B$.)
    \item $P^{\mathfrak{A}}$ is a permutation of $|\mathfrak{A}|$; i.e., $P^{\mathfrak{A}}$ is a one-to-one function with domain and range equal to $|\mathfrak{A}|$.\qedhere
